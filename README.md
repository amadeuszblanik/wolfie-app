## About the project
After becoming a proud dog dad of a Standard Schnauzer in 2022, I searched for an application to help me manage standard dog care tasks such as health, weight, feeding, and heat tracking. Since I couldn't find a suitable app, I decided to create one as an open-source project, hoping it would be useful for other dog owners.

Additionally, this project provided a great opportunity to learn more about SwiftUI, Nest.JS, and test new technologies.
